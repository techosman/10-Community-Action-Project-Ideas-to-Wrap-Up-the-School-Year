                   <p>Spring is here, the weather is warming, and students are getting antsy. The school year is wrapping up. Teachers want to end the year with a bang, but are also exhausted and don't know how much more they have left in them to give! It's testing season, graduation season, grade report season. Ah! Spring is bonkers in the world of education. </p>
                   <p>So What better way to cruise through the rest of the year and go out with a bang than with community action projects (CAPs)?</p>
                   <p>Community action projects are self-directed project-based service-learning experiences. In summary, students choose a local or global issue of interest and/or personal relevance, design an action plan, and take action.</p>
                   <p>Community action projects are interesting, multidisciplinary, and student-directed, which means there is little to no preparation involved on your part. You guide and facilitate. If you're not sure how to facilitate these experiences, go back to last week's post - How to Facilitate Community Action Projects in Four Easy Steps.</p>
                   <p>AND, check out my portfolio of CAP resources to save yourself an enormous amount of planning time in this crazy season.</p>

                   <p>One question you might have is how to assess these experiences? Rather than test students, have them compile their project outcomes into a project e-portfolio﻿, Take mine for free! Students can add evidence of learning with photographs and videos, add their rubrics and reflections, you can add a narrative, and more!</p>

                   <h1>1. Awareness Campaign: </h1>
                   <p>Students design a campaign that would educate the public on the issue of interest. They could create posters, t-shirts, a video promotion, etc. They can get super creative with this one, and the options are endless, especially with social media and other technologies having come onto the scene as of late.</p>
                   <h1>2. Design and Make a Product: </h1>
                   <p>The idea behind this one is that students design and make something that raises awareness and provides a tangible outcome. The product should be usable or sellable to raise money for the cause. </p>
                   <p>An example is taking an invasive species, such as buckthorn here in MN, and using it as material for a product to sell such as a bracelet or waste basket. This action plan mitigates the buckthorn problem and brings in money (selling the product at a school function, in boutiques, or on Etsy) to use toward a permanent, long term solution (ex: donating the funds to a local conservation organization). This is a great option for the makers of the world!</p>
                   <h1>3. Innovative Strategy to Raise Awareness:</h1>
                   <p>Imagine a student is interested in the issue of teen pregnancy. One way to raise awareness would be to create a brochure with some info and stats on the issue and pass it around town. Okay. That is technically raising awareness, but it's not a head turner. </p>
                   <p>One of my students did her community action project on teen pregnancy. She created a website with information about teen pregnancy, assembled HUNDREDS of fortune-tellers (paper origami game), and added a link to her website with instructions on how to enter a drawing. The purpose was to share information in an interesting and meaningful way, and she did just that.</p>
